# WASI Filesystem API

## `wasi-filesystem`
```wit
/// WASI filesystem is a filesystem API primarily intended to let users run WASI
/// programs that access their files on their existing filesystems, without
/// significant overhead.
///
/// It is intended to be roughly portable between Unix-family platforms and
/// Windows, though it does not hide many of the major differences.
///
/// Paths are passed as interface-type `string`s, meaning they must consist of
/// a sequence of Unicode Scalar Values (USVs). Some filesystems may contain paths
/// which are not accessible by this API.
///
/// The directory separator in WASI is always the forward-slash (`/`).
///
/// All paths in WASI are relative paths, and are interpreted relative to a
/// `descriptor` referring to a base directory. If a `path` argument to any WASI
/// function starts with `/`, or if any step of resolving a `path`, including
/// `..` and symbolic link steps, reaches a directory outside of the base
/// directory, or reaches a symlink to an absolute or rooted path in the
/// underlying filesystem, the function fails with `errno::perm`.
